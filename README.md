- 👋 Hi, I’m @Watchingmonster1
- 👀 I’m interested in coding games, mostly using Unity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning. In a sense, aren't we all?
- 💞️ I’m looking to "collaborate", A.K.A. I made this account so I could take someone else's code and tweak it.
- 📫 How to reach me: First, you extend your arm in my direction. Continue doing this until your touch sensors feel something. Second, look at the thing that you just touched. If it's not me, go back to the first step. If it is me, congrats! You've reached me!
